    text: '<p>Afrikan Sciences, aka Eric Douglas Porter, is a multi-instrumentalist and producer whose output over the last decade contains some of the most idiosyncratic dance-adjacent music I''ve ever encountered. He''s released dozens of uniquely off-kilter jams for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/47600-Deepblak">Deepblak</a>, run by longtime friend and collaborator <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/203602-Aybee">Aybee</a>, and had a breakthrough moment with a full-length on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Afrikan-Sciences-Circuitous/master/766726">PAN</a> in 2014. Alongside all that, he''s remained dedicated to self-releasing music at an impressive clip, and <i>Photon Wizard </i>is the latest breathtaking example.&nbsp;</p><p>Across the album''s eight tracks, the vibe swings from low-slung beat-tape shuffle to twitchy drum-machine punch-ups, all anchored to Porter''s signature "shambolic" arrangement style, where the rhythm grid is stretched and twisted into unearthly grooves.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are echoes of MPC pioneers like Theo Parrish or "Shake" Shakir, Porter''s uncanny ability to collage together musical dialects is what sets his music apart. Muffled boom-bap sits comfortably in the mix with razor-sharp digital samples, and hand-played funk bass throbs under stews of punchy Bristolian percussion.</p><p>Available direct from the man himself on <a href="https://afrikansciences.bandcamp.com/album/photon-wizard">Bandcamp</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>'
