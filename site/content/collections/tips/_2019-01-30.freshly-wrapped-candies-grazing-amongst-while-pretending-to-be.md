    text: '<p>There''s something about underground experimental music from California that I''ve often struggled to put my finger on... A certain zaniness, an affinity for camp, a high threshold for goof-ballery... At the academic level, prestigious institutions like Mills and Stanford have given platforms to dozens of "serious" innovators, but at the DIY level, some of the state''s most influential artists rock a full-on looney tunes aesthetic to much acclaim. This is especially true in my adopted home of the Bay Area, where the post-punk influence of Ralph Records turned a generation of musical outsiders into post-modern jokers, and young minds are continually warped by the "world''s a stage" post-carnival whimsy of Burning Man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>As far as my own tastes go, I have a limited appetite for wackiness. I''m not some self-serious maniac who only listens to impenetrable noise, but the obtuse whimsy of Zappa turns my stomach. I''m continually exploring the boundaries of my taste here, because I know plenty of well-respected collectors who have unlimited reverence for some incredibly clownish music, and I''m nothing if not curious. Which brings me to the release at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>This album, the first by California weirdos Freshly Wrapped Candies, is a perfect example of a zany aesthetic applied well. Self-released in a miniscule edition in 1985, I stumbled across the album in the hallowed halls of KALX''s music library, digging to pass the time during a graveyard shift on air.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
