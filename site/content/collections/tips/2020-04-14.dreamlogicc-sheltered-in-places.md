    text: '<p>Oakland producer Justin James has been steadfastly digging his own hole for the better part of the last two decades. His long-running solo project <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1127844-Dreamlogicc" target="_blank">Dreamlogicc</a> has racked up dozens of releases exploring the vast, dank caverns beneath American techno. Across labels like <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/223637-Kimochi" target="_blank">Kimochi</a>, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/499444-Jacktone" target="_blank">Jacktone</a>, and his own <a href="https://peaktimedancemusic.bandcamp.com/music" target="_blank">Peak Time Dance Music</a>, his sound is wide-ranging:&nbsp; glistening dub minimalism, chugging kosmische, and wild-pitch techno jamming, all executed with a spacious restraint and intuitive flair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When he''s not producing, DJ Lgcc hosts the wildly entertaining&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/waxncats" target="_blank">Wax n'' Cats</a>&nbsp;stream from his home (aka Main Drain Studios), where he spins wide-ranging vinyl cuts every Saturday to the lazy bemusement of his two cats, whose on-cam antics place the stream somewhere between a live DJ set and streaming wildlife feed.</p>'

    text: '<p>Justin''s latest EP, <i>Sheltered in Places</i>, released into the anxious languor of the COVID-19 quarantine, finds him exploring a new facet of his sound. The churning hypnotism of his more technoid productions is pushed aside to make room for dubby bass weight, and slow-mo two-step grooves. The five tracks here cultivate a home-grown strain of club-ready shuffle, balancing dry, hi-fi zappage with growling bass and "weightless" atmospherics. From the mutant tresillo of <i>Ever Vescent Ascent </i>to the resonant droplets on <i>Psychology &amp; Bass</i>, James manages to weld his own non-standard vision onto a lumbering skeleton of UK Bass, crafting a killer EP that''s as bizarre as it is engrossing. Non-canonical club constructions that sound like nothing else.</p><p><a href="https://peaktimedancemusic.bandcamp.com/album/dreamlogicc-sheltered-in-places-ptdmsip" target="_blank">Grip the album now on Bandcamp.</a></p><p><br></p>'
