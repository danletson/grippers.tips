    text: '<p>Flanger Magazine is an occasional guise of Kentucky synthesist / songwriter Chris Bush, and Breslin is his first full-length under the alias. Chris first came to my attention as a member of Lexington synth trio&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1020918-Caboladies">Caboladies</a>, giants of the kosmische that was sweeping the basements, galleries, and industrial spaces of the US in the mid-2000s. Seeing this LP pop up in recommendation from several friends provided a perfect invitation to check back in on Bush''s body of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Breslin is a surprising collection of miniature compositions for acoustic guitar and synthetic sound, steeped in a breezy yet melancholy atmosphere. Chris''s guitar playing is informal yet entirely affecting, recorded with a bedroom intimacy and capturing a forlorn tenderness. The hand-played synthetic accompaniments are perfectly matched, turning plaintive finger-picking into baroque pastorales, and lyrical strumming into retro-futurist moonscapes. I hear echos of baroque-pop wonderment like <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Pidgeon-Pidgeon/release/1972162">Pidgeon</a>&nbsp;and the synth-kissed classical of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/Linda-Cohen-Leda/master/1226809">Linda Cohen</a>, but Bush forges an aesthetic entirely his own, that''s not only uniquely charming, but eminently re-listenable.&nbsp;</p><p>Limited LP and digital available on <a href="https://sophomorelounge.bandcamp.com/album/flanger-magazine-breslin">Bandcamp</a>.</p>'
