    text: '<p>Madteo is without a doubt one of the most confounding artists operating on the fringes of "club-oriented" music today. A longtime New Yorker, he''s dug his own hole for more than a decade, carving rough, stuttering soundscapes that refuse to sit comfortably in any "canon" of electronic music. Reputation-wise, he''s got endless cred, with a decade of releases on cult labels like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/985-S%C3%A4hk%C3%B6-Recordings">Sähkö</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/204374-Wania">Wania</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/77034-Workshop">Workshop</a>, but does most of his unclassifiable <i>thing</i> in the DIY margins, via ephemeral SoundCloud tracks, cryptic Tumblr posts, and most recently on <a href="https://madteo.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">his own Bandcamp page</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>NiteMARE NOSTRUM </i>is a monumental product of this obtuse artistic practice. A 2+ hour epic: part DJ mix, part free-associative audio collage, launched in three parts, and available as a free download.&nbsp;</p><p>The title jacks a roman term for the Mediterranean, meaning “our sea.” Outside of Madteo’s Italian birthplace, it’s a reference that’s as obtuse as anything else in his ever-expanding head-cannon, but it''s fitting enough for this project, a vast and churning ocean of re-contextualized sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Madteo''s muse is New York City itself, as he collages local color commentary, dollar bin house, pirate radio interviews, and hip-hop freestyles into long-form aural storytelling that almost transcends DJing entirely. It''s a deeply weird, supremely listenable plunderphonic ode to the occult history America’s most diverse city, cynical and nostalgic in equal measure.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>The sequencing is all over the place in a way that’s uniquely Madteo, that is to say: <b>fully hybridized</b>. Cheeky / menacing, narrative / hypnogogic, frantic / glacial. His original bits employ rumbling, saturated sub bass loops, glitchy digital detritus, and harshly chopped samples, echoing subterranean beat-tape masters like Spectre and contemporary street-level innovators Standing on the Corner. There''s even a few appearances from fellow down-for-life NYC freestyle freaker Sensational. As for the borrowed music, almost every sound source is bathed in some sort of grit. Stepped-on dollar-bin 12”s, sun-baked mixtape cuts, and blown-out looping fragments.</p><p>I had the distinct pleasure of catching one of Madteo’s disorienting performances in SF last year (shoutout RS94109!) The selections were more consistently dance-able, but the knack for head-scratching bricolage was in full effect. A master in a game no one else can even play.&nbsp;</p><p>Don''t sleep on copping the <a href="https://madteo.bandcamp.com/track/nitemare-nostrum-pt-1" target="_blank">whole</a> <a href="https://madteo.bandcamp.com/track/nitemare-nostrum-pt-2" target="_blank">epic</a> <a href="https://madteo.bandcamp.com/track/nitemare-nostrum-pt-3" target="_blank">set</a> while you can, as the man is known for his capricious publishing habits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
