    text: '<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2773389-Niagara-6" target="_blank">Niagara</a> is a rare treasure in the world of contemporary dance-adjacent music: a collaborative group who have truly dug their own hole. The wildly innovative Portuguese trio has released a steady stream of off-kilter cuts via venerable labels like <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/313253-Pr%C3%ADncipe" target="_blank">Príncipe</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/766460-F-T-D" target="_blank">FTD</a>, but most of their mystifying output has been relegated to tiny-run CDrs and 7”s on their own <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/884459-Ascender" target="_blank">Ascender</a> imprint, cementing their joyously anarchic aesthetic. Last year, after over a dozen perfectly zonked outings, the crew has gone digital, uploading some of their wooliest hits to the web.&nbsp;</p><p><i>37</i>, originally released as a 12” in 2017, is a four track trip through Niagara’s wonderfully bent sound world. Melodic house moves are knocked down and lashed back together into a chunky, lurching mess that’s wildly entertaining. Squiggly portamento, faux-ass digital drum clatter, and a smoke-filled basement’s worth of improvisational ingenuity.&nbsp;</p><p>Grip it now, along with the rest of the crew’s twisted oeuvre over at <a href="https://niagaraascender.bandcamp.com/album/37">Bandcamp</a>.<br></p>'
