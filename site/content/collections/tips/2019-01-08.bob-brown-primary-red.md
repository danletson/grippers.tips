    text: '<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/26407-Bob-Brown">Bob Brown</a> is a US underground techno producer who started his own label, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/5778-Framework-Music">Framework Music</a>, after several years as a Philadelphia DJ in the mid-90s. He kicked off the label with gusto in 1999, pressing three EPs showcasing his unique brand of hardware beat wizardry, color coded <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Bob-Brown-SeriesPrimary/release/34554">Yellow</a>, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Bob-Brown-SeriesPrimary/release/42815">Red</a>, and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Bob-Brown-SeriesPrimary/release/42685">Blue</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I first stumbled across Bob''s work as I do most records, attempting to pad out a Discogs order a few years back. When I first heard a sample of Primary:Yellow (via the exact YouTube vid below), I knew I''d found something special.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>The track, (Yellow 4) was bizarre in all my favorite ways. The intricate, twitchy rhythms, blasted recording spec, and unique sound palette had me hooked immediately. I quickly snatched up the rest of the "Primary" series from the same seller and smashed the "buy" button right then and there.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, as I was preparing to launch Grippers'' Tips, I discovered, much to my joy, that Bob had taken it upon himself to create a <a href="https://bob-brown.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> page, uploading most of his own material from the Framework days. That kind of DIY archival spirit is a huge part of what inspired me to get back to blogging about music in a post-mediafire world, and I was thrilled I could share Bob''s back catalog in a way that involved him directly.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings me to the subject of this post, the first Framework release (and my favorite), <i>Primary:Red</i>. The EP''s sound and energy bring to mind some of the woolier releases from dirt-techno instigators like Jamal Moss or any number of LIES-affiliated jammers, but with an alien production spec that sets them apart. The four tracks are all mid-tempo techno jams, with hard knockin'' kicks, punchy <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/sci/drumtrx.php">DrumTraks</a> percussion, and Bob''s signature blown-out, straight-to-the-DAT atmospheres. Each cut has its own internal logic, but they all coalesce into robotically twitching monsters of raw nervous energy. There''s plenty of classic four-on-the-floor kick / hat business, but contaminated with arrhythmic growls, whirlwind cymbal-work, and vintage wild-pitch techno zaps. The last track goes rogue, with a lurching, syncopated percussion loop that gets slowly deep fried into oblivion for an apocalyptic closer. Crunchy!</p><p>Discogs copies of the original wax are still floating around for the collectors, but do the right thing and cop Bob''s weird and wonderful back catalog <a href="https://bob-brown.bandcamp.com/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>'
