    text: '<p>Dolo Percussion is the fun-loving "drums only" alias of DC''s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1183098-Andrew-Field-Pickering" target="_blank">Andrew Field-Pickering</a> aka Max D, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/117386-Future-Times" target="_blank">Future Times</a> label boss and half of <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1247572-Beautiful-Swimmers" target="_blank">Beautiful Swimmers</a>. To date, he''s dropped three 4-trackers under the Dolo banner on sizzlin'' hot labels like LIES and The Trilogy Tapes. <i>Dolo 4 </i>collects the project''s work to date, bundled with 4 new heaters.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Every cut blends hi-fi club-tuned percussion with iconic sounds from old-school beat boxes, beefed up into weapons of dancefloor destruction. Errant vocal stabs give you the dopamine rush of all your favorite freestyle dubs, plus wild-pitch improv flavor with plenty of slip-slidin’ snares and hectic wheel-ups. The latest quartet of tunes dials back the tempos without losing an ounce of the bounce, with hazy phasing clatter and wafting metallics woven through the grooves, like Timbaland remixing PG Sound.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>There''s a quote I think about a lot from legendary NYC free jazz drummer Jerome Cooper, known for his multi-instrumental dexterity across a variety of "ethnic"/indigenous styles. It comes from the liner notes of his 1988 album <i><a href="https://www.discogs.com/Jerome-Cooper-Quintet-Outer-And-Interactions/release/1768904" target="_blank">Outer and Interactions</a></i>.<br></p><blockquote><p>One other idea I would like to state is that I do not play African, Indian, Chinese, or European music. I play basically an evolutionary American Music of the Drums.</p></blockquote><p>I love that term, unwieldy as it is, and think it captures the kind of hybridized bashment Dolo brings to the table: house, jazz, club, hip hop, broken beat, plus that extra special flex. Deep in the game since the turn of the millennium, Andrew’s 20-year love affair with genre-twisting boom-bap culminates here in a massive comp of seriously danceable workouts, coming for Rick Rock’s crown as the King of Slaps. The beats may be BONUS but the release is MANDATORY. </p><p>Cop now on <a href="https://futuretimes.bandcamp.com/album/dolo-4" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>.<br><br></p>'
