    text: '<p>The Kooky Scientist is the now-defunct moniker of Boston techno lifer and former Pyschic TV member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/17581-Fred-Giannelli">Fred Gianelli</a>. This, his first EP under the name, was released on Richie Hawtin''s Plus 8 Records in 1994.&nbsp;</p><p>Four cuts of bouncy, minimalist acid, with a distinctly chunky / cheeky approach to sound design that''s stripped down yet full of home-brewed character. Quirky synth lines, classic PCM drums, and bizarre fills that fuck up the groove in a way that''s twistedly satisfying. Perfect tracks for warming up your next hardware acid set, or for bopping along in the kitchen. Still massively available and affordable, with digis on <a href="https://www.beatport.com/release/blue-movie/246935">Beatport</a>&nbsp;and dollar-bin wax all over <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/15344?ev=rb">Discogs</a>.&nbsp;</p>'
