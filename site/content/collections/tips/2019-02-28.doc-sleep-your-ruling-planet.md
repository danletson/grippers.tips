    text: '<p>Doc Sleep, the ever-industrious Berlin-based DJ / producer / promoter / label-head delivers an impressive new EP of esoteric club material on her own imprint, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/499444-Jacktone" target="_blank">Jacktone Records</a>.</p><p>While Doc Sleep''s previous outings have been aimed more squarely at the dancefloor, this one revels in its left-field appeal. <i>Your Ruling Planet</i>&nbsp;fills out the deep, big-room spaciousness of previous releases with more upfront percussion and intimately detailed ambience. There''s nary a four-on-the-floor to be found, as Doc melds the high-contrast sound design of bricoleurs like <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/4299757-Willow-18" target="_blank">Willow</a> or <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/824484-Margaret-Dygas" target="_blank">Margaret Dygas</a> onto a foundation of spiky, Bristolian percussion. Liminal knocks, smudged ambience, and looped field recordings float untethered through stereo space, creating a unified sense of otherworldliness, as the tracks veer between laid-back mystery and twitchy paranoia.<br></p><p><i>Baltic Amber</i> sounds like<i> </i>Seefeel''s <i>Succour</i> on 45, with sharply delayed amen snares ringing out over bubbling, jazzy melodics. The title track is the anthem of the release, with relentless, stuttering kicks, rolling bass, and half-time swing. The album''s closer is an affecting track of rhythmelodic ambient, straight out of the <i>Burger/Ink</i> playbook. Fully structured but wonderfully transportive.&nbsp;</p><p>Doc Sleep''s work as a curator for Jacktone and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/promoter.aspx?id=68628" target="_blank">Room 4 Resistance</a> hinges on making space for emerging, independent voices from local scenes around the world, and <i>Your Ruling Planet</i> is a unique collection of dancefloor mysticism from one of the underground''s true champions. Don''t sleep!</p><p><a href="https://jacktonerecords.bandcamp.com/album/your-ruling-planet" target="_blank">Grab the whole digital release on Bandcamp</a>.&nbsp;</p>'
