    text: '<p><a href="https://tomu.bandcamp.com/music" target="_blank">Tomu</a> is an emerging DJ and producer from Oakland, tightly affiliated with party crew <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grlhouse/" target="_blank">Girl House</a>. While her past production efforts have been deconstructed club jams and post-everything ballroom edits, her latest release, <i>Dream About Fruit</i>, is somehow both more straightforward and less predictable: 2 relentlessly banging 150bpm instrumentals, without a hook or sample in sight. The only description on the digital release is "West coast electronic music", and though that might sound intentionally vague, I like to imagine it''s a brand new style still emerging from the petri dish of global club sounds in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Banana</i> is like an over-cranked gqom track: rolling, chunky snares, bouncing bass, vaporous synth clouds, and a non-stop ADHD synth arpeggio like something out of a long-lost Sega Saturn soundtrack. <i>Orange</i> boasts syncopated footwork kicks caught up in a whirlwind of polyrhythmic percussion: flanged hats, soca clanks, electro snares, and spinback cuts. Both tracks are mixed loud + tight, leaving plenty of space for every hit. Playful, high-energy bops guaranteed to get stuck in your brain. Can''t wait to hear more!</p><p><a href="https://tomu.bandcamp.com/album/dream-about-fruit" target="_blank">Grip the EP on Bandcamp.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>'
