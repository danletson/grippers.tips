    text: '<p>New York Avant percussionist / composer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/245837-David-Linton" target="_blank">David Linton</a>''s first (and only) solo LP is a wild ride through various twisted veins of New York post-modern avant-gardism circa Reagan''s second term. Released on Glenn Branca''s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/145071-Neutral-Records-3" target="_blank">Neutral Records</a>&nbsp;near the end of its run in 1986, <i>Orchesography</i> is a harrowing, chunky romp through the signifiers of NYC''s "Downtown Scene" heyday, executed with a metric ton of twitchy, off-kilter energy.&nbsp;</p><p>The album''s 6 lengthy tracks blend the randomized sample-delica of explorers like Christian Marclay or Nicolas Collins with the grinding, industrial-funk chug of Bill Laswell''s early outings. Cheeky classical samples, stomping DMX, and mega-fuzzed guitar skronk congeal into aspics of street-level low-bitrate crud, gelatinous and sharp in equal measure. I want to say "Art of Noise on acid" but the post-metal shred aspect of some tracks makes whiskey and speed more believable.&nbsp;</p><p>The album''s maximalist approach and sardonic energy give the whole thing a bludgeoning, hypnogogic vibe, like a cartoonish fever dream, topped with cover art on that whole Melvins-ass "dark kitsch" tip so you know it''s a hard Gen X affair. Recommended for fans of <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/51073-Death-Comet-Crew" target="_blank">Death Comet Crew</a> or the first <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Praxis-1984/release/458170" target="_blank">Praxis</a> album, though the cuts here are even more zonked in terms of sound design and sheer jump-cut schizo spec. An unheralded cross-brow masterpiece.</p><p>Not a peep on the ''net, so <a href="https://archive.org/compress/david-linton-orchesography/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/david-linton-orchesography.zip" target="_blank">grip the whole thing here</a>.</p>'
