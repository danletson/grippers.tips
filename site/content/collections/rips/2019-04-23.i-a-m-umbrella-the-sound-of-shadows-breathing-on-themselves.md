    text: '<p>The unusually-named I.A.M. Umbrella is a collaborative project of mysterious Californian Rick Tamura aka R. Kitsch. <i>The Sound of Shadows Breathing on Themselves</i>, the project''s fourth and final full-length, dropped on CD in 1995, a co-release between German industrial label <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/71167-Drag-Drop" target="_blank">Drag &amp; Drop</a> and Tamura''s own weirdo DIY imprint <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/39809-Rays-and-Genius-Collective-Music" target="_blank">Rays and Genius Collective</a>. The nearly hour-long album is a through-composed collection of unique, post-industrial loop-scapes and early digital shimmer.</p><p>Most tracks consist of neatly looping field recordings, subtly aliased dark ambient washes, and concr√©te flourishes. Simple synthetic melodies waft through the murk, lending a sense of nostalgic melancholia. These wistful touches occasionally veer dangerously close to full-on "haunted playroom" territory, but for the most part remain tastefully restrained, looping languidly over the humid soundscapes. At a few points, the morass solidifies into spiky, tribal-industrial jams, built from chunky, pitched percussion grooves and wailing flute, in a kind of post-prog / dark-new-age montage.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>While the world''s dollar bins are clogged with a million (bad) albums of this kind of world/tribal/industrial thing, I.A.M. Umbrella succeeds where other fail. Far from the bone-headed dirges or oppressive synth-wankery of most contemporary "industrial/tribal" albums, the album''s atmospheres court a touching fragility, with a genuine knack for tasteful bricolage that''s tailor-made for headphone zoning (check the sound clip for a prime example). Maybe most importantly, the group manages to build a uniquely haunting "post-world" vibe without guitars, drums, or vocals; much closer in spirit to the Benjamin Lew / Crammed Discs axis than Tribes of Neurot.&nbsp;</p><p>The last few years have seen the recent rediscovery of industrial-adjacent acts from the ''90s like <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/15428-Pablos-Eye" target="_blank">Pablo''s Eye</a> and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/79244-MAAT" target="_blank">MAAT</a> by a broader community of experimental enthusiasts, and this album scratches that post-ambient itch nicely. CD copies are still going for next to nothing on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/374544" target="_blank">Discogs</a>, and the whole thing can be <a href="https://archive.org/compress/i-a-m-umbrella-the-sound-of-shadows-breathing-on-themselves/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/i-a-m-umbrella-the-sound-of-shadows-breathing-on-themselves.zip" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>.&nbsp;</p>'
