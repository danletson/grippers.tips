    text: '<p>This lovely slab of acidic goodness is one of my absolute favorite Discogs accidents. I tossed it in the cart on account of the tasteful silver label design and rock-bottom price tag, but almost did a double-take when I finally gave it a spin.&nbsp;Disorienting, off-kilter beats, zonked acidic pulsing, and a punishing, totally unique sound design that can only be described as "Vainio-esque". The closest comparison I can think of is Beau Wanzer''s brand of basement-dwelling electro, but executed with a level of German precision that sets it apart.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/28779-Antisept">Antisept</a> is a short-lived project of Oliver Braun, a producer based in Kassel, Germany, releasing 3 EPs in as many years on Thomas P. Heckmann''s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/2268-Trope-Recordings">Trope Recordings</a>. Of the three, this 1996 slab goes the hardest, full of DJ-beguiling rhythmic tricks like misplaced kicks and overlaid time signatures, and crackling with radioactive energy.</p><p>There are still plenty of dirt-cheap copies floating around <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Antisept-02/release/53536">Discogs</a>, if vinyl''s your thing.</p>'
