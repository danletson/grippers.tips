    text: '<p>This underrated slab comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/1040-End-to-End" target="_blank">End to End</a>, a Detroit label established on the tail end of the Midwest techno boom of the late 90s. The EP collects four taught, streamlined techno tools by a handful of lesser-known local talents, showcasing the serious production chops and dancefloor instincts that the motor city seems to cultivate in even its more obscure artists.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>The highlight here is the lead-off cut, the only Discogs credit of the enigmatic Nevmega, entitled "I Love Detroit". The track is built around a bit-crushed sample of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfxEbZr8Tjo">Sade''s <i>Pearls</i></a>, morphing the song''s heart-wrenching strings into barn-storming techno catharsis with pounding four-on-the-floor stomp and clattering snares. A perfect outsider anthem.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A guest remix by minimal techno innovator and Detroit legend Terrance Dixon takes the track <i>Driving While Black</i> in a seriously deep and dark direction, while ADT delivers <i>the Power</i>, a mysterious, pad-driven roller augmented by twitchy arpeggiations, and odd sampled phrases like jaw harp and flute.&nbsp;</p><p>The final track is a more left-field swing from electro stalwart <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/4804-Erotek">Erotek</a>, where ethnic hand-percussion loops tumble over ghettotech claps and sliced-and-diced piano fragments, flexing on a bouncing, wigged-out tip.&nbsp;</p><p>With such strong, floor-filling material from everyone involved, it''s a shame these cuts haven''t made the jump to legit digital realms. Until they do, <a href="https://archive.org/compress/various-artists-post-detroit-techno/formats=VBR%20MP3&amp;file=/various-artists-post-detroit-techno.zip" target="_blank">grip the whole thing here</a>, or <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/list?master_id=925714" target="_blank">cop the vinyl while it''s still dirt cheap</a>.</p>'
