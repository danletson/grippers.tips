    text: '<p>I do my best to share a good mix of vibes on Grippers'' Tips, but since it''s the one-year anniversary of the site''s launch, I''m taking a trip down memory lane to double dip on a <a href="https://grippers.tips/rip/mark-broom-dave-hill-skool-beats-inner-life" target="_blank">previously featured act</a>. <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/6314-Repeat" target="_blank">Repeat</a> is a collaborative alias of UK techno legend <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/459-Mark-Broom" target="_blank">Mark Broom</a>, whose massive discography reaches back to the early ''90s. On this wonderful four-tracker (the last under the pseudonym), Mark teams up with his longtime pal <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/49518-Dave-Hill" target="_blank">Dave Hill</a> for a collection of late-night moods. While the duo''s catalog spans everything from disco edits to stomping hardcore, this one finds them deep in the pocket of something all their own.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Easter</i> kicks things off in slow-mo, with minimal, hand-crafted breakbeats rolling over icy IDM pads, and a breakdown that sounds like the Diwali riddim on Uranus. <i>Scattered </i>is another downtempo number, matching an infectious, jazzy stomp with thick subs harmonized to clouds of Detroit shimmer. <i>Silver</i> ratchets up the BPM but maintains the mystery: jittery, flam-filled breaks chug along relentlessly, while a thick buzzy synth line meanders across the frequency spectrum in half time.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, the only down note is <i>Studio 6.1.22</i>, which is a bit of a botched attempt at roots-y dub (maybe the lads weren''t feeling it much themselves, since they didn''t bother to name it). Everything else is pure gold; idiosyncratic and expertly produced. Totally satisfying in its energetic synthesis of all the not-quite-techno influences that bubble beneath the surface of so many turn-of-the-millennium releases.</p><p>Still highly grippable in its <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/73051" target="_blank">plastic form on Discogs</a>, and the <a href="https://archive.org/compress/repeat-uxb007/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/repeat-uxb007.zip" target="_blank">full rip is available here</a>.</p><p><br></p>'
