    text: '<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/153814-Computer-Soup" target="_blank">Computer Soup</a> is a collective of improvisors from Tokyo, founded in 1993. Originally conceived as an acoustic jazz quintet, busking on the streets of Shibuya, the group quickly evolved in a decidedly more transcendent direction, incorporating extended techniques and subtle electronics towards a kind of post-jazz ambient that would become their signature. In the late ''90s, the group was tightly associated with Japan''s eclectic post-crash underground, appearing on compilations featuring everything from cutup boom-bap to kitchen-sink noise collage, on labels like <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/23152-Shi-Ra-Nui" target="_blank">Shi-Ra-Nui</a>, and on the group''s own <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/5423-Soup-Disk" target="_blank">Soup Disk</a>.</p><p>Despite their adjacency to such eclectic-fetishism, Computer Soup''s aesthetic is singularly defined: painterly compositions conjured from a modicum of sonic materials. Their catalog of a dozen-plus releases features fluctuations in personnel, instrumentation, and recording fidelity, but their aesthetic is admirably consistent in its hypnotizing charm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'

      <p><i>Urumuchistan</i>&nbsp;is a 1999 CDr that perfectly encapsulates the group's lowercase conceptualism. Released in 1999 on Shi-Ra-Nui sublabel <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/29893-360-Records" target="_blank">360º Records</a>, the physical album is a wonderfully inscrutable artifact. An unmarked silver CD in a green-on-clear jewel case baring minimal credits and these esoteric liner notes, via minuscule text on a translucent sticker:<br><br></p><p>COMPUTER SOUP URUMUCHISTAN<br></p><p>

Sparse muted trumpet, plaintive piano, and hypnotic hand percussion intertwine in patient counterpoint over beds of restrained electronics: often sparse, keening oscillations or panning rhythmic noise. Odd harmonic intervals and mutated phrasings keep the proceedings dynamic and engaging, while the relatively short track lengths give each sonic scene a mellow dreaminess that never overstays its welcome.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As for sonic comparisons, the alien sound design and slowly unfolding arrangements evoke Miles Davis's <i>He Loved Him Madly</i> or Arve Henriksen's <i>Chiaroscuro</i>, but with a disarming lack of pretension. Miles away from ECM-lineage studio perfection, Computer Soup's takes are saturated with tape hiss and room tone, every track a self-contained miniature full of gritty detail.&nbsp;</p><p>The band's genius, to me, is that they thread the needle of so many late '90s experimental niches in such a brilliant way. They do the No Neck Blues Band low-key improv thing without resorting to witchy theatrics, and embrace creative electronics while steering well clear of overwrought clicks-n-cuts pointillism or shock-and-awe DSP abuse. Computer Soup's compositions are <i>vibes</i> first and foremost, and <i>Urumuchistan</i> is a stellar, 46-minute example of their unique brand of alien mood music.</p><p>As a limited CDr, <i>Urumuchistan</i> is among the more rare offerings from Computer Soup's catalog, and completely lacking any kind of digital release.
