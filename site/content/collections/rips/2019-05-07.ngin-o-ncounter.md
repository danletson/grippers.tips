    text: '<p>Ngin-o is the nom de plume of Hamilton, Ontario producer and DJ&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/27317-Oliver-Barkovic" target="_blank">Oliver "Ollie" Barkovic</a>, founder of cult techno label <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/8421-Steel-City-Records" target="_blank">Steel City Records</a>. Active since the late 80s in various scenes in the Buffalo / Cleveland / Toronto / Detroit axis,&nbsp;<i>Ncounter</i> is Ollie''s first EP for his own imprint, originally released in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>The four cuts here are the kind of colorful, kinetic, and genre-averse techno that proliferated in various Midwestern scenes during the 1990s. Saturated kicks, twitchy, clanking percussion, and mutant synth lines, all recorded with a punchy, just-shy-of-distorted lo-fi intensity that gives them a special ability to cut through any mix. The first two tracks are zonked bangers, pounding out patterns of monophonic synth zappage without a melody in sight. On the flip, things take a turn for the emotional, with <i>Luxor</i>''s spaced-out acidic arpeggios and <i>Tors Nude</i>''s soulful pianos &amp; pads.&nbsp;</p><p>Steel City has made the leap to <a href="https://steelcityrecords.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>, but no sign of a back catalog yet. The 12" is still mighty cheap on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/1662328" target="_blank">Discogs</a>, or <a href="https://archive.org/compress/ngin-o-ncounter/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/ngin-o-ncounter.zip" target="_blank">grab the full 320 rip here</a>.<br></p>'
