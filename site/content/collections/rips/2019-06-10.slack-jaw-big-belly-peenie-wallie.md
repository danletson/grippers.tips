    text: '<p>According to Discgos, Slack Jaw is a one-off project of legendary Sheffield producer and DJ <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/67842-Winston-Hazel" target="_blank">Winston Hazel</a>. Best known as 1/3 of <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2913-Forgemasters" target="_blank">Forgemasters</a>, Hazel and co. helped solidify the sound of Sheffield Bleep in the early ''90s, penning <i>Track with No Name&nbsp;</i>as the inaugural release on Warp Records in 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>By the second half of the ''90s, Warp''s reputation outgrew their Sheffield roots, but the scene''s founders continued to innovate. In 1996, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/6851-Earth-Records" target="_blank">Earth Records</a> was founded by Hazel''s longtime friend and fellow Bleep pioneer <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/490679-Richard-Barratt" target="_blank">Richard Barratt</a>, to foster the weirder side of the city''s thriving underground.&nbsp;</p><p>This was about as much background as I could find on the open web, from a <a href="http://testpressing.org/2013/08/20-questions-richard-barratt-parrot-crooked-man/" target="_blank">Test Pressing interview with Barratt</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Then I started Earth Records and put out loads of grunky Industrial Dancehall / Jungle / Tech sounding stuff. Not just by me. Stuff by Winni, Mark Brydon, Ross Orton, I Monster etc. Non of which can be found on Youtube, but youâ€™ll probably be able to get the full set off Discogs for a fiver ha ha!</p></blockquote><p>If that''s note a winning description, I don''t know what is! The quote is from 2013, but unfortunately the piece about the label''s under-the-radar status is still true to this day.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to the record at hand: The third 12" on Earth, this mysterious single takes a thoroughly hybrid approach to beat-making, blending all kinds of 90s club signifiers into wonky chimeras of spirited, bass-heavy techno.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The A side is an IDM-adjacent machine funk groover with uniquely bouncy twist.&nbsp;Boom-bap breakbeats and Prince-esque Drumtraks claps, peppered with big-beat turntable hijinks and trippy spoken word samples. About halfway through, the track breaks into Detroit-lineage melodic techno shimmer, balancing out the playful vibe with a touch of soul.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On the flip, "Peenie Wallie" is dub-tinged half-time chonk, complete with liquid snare fills, bouncy synth bass, and snakey acid lines sure to please ravers and two-steppers alike.&nbsp;</p><p>I for one would love to see the whole Earth catalog get the Bandcamp treatment, but until that time, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/30879" target="_blank">snatch up the still-semi-affordable wax on Discogs</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/compress/slack-jaw-big-belly-peenie-wallie/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/slack-jaw-big-belly-peenie-wallie.zip" target="_blank">grab the whole rip here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>'
