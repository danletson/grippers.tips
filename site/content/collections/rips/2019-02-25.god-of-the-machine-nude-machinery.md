    text: '<p>Overlooked gem of classic groovy Detroit action from 1996, courtesy of Derrick Thompson aka <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/9781-Drivetrain" target="_blank">Drivetrain</a>. Whether he meant to choose one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_the_Machine" target="_blank">cornerstones of Libertarianism</a> as his <i>nom-de-plume</i> is probably a question not worth asking, but the recorded results are killer all the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Chunky kicks, soulful lo-fi chords, and swinging preset percussion. I''d describe it as a true hybrid of early 90s techno and house vibes, but "tech-house" is way off the mark. It''s the kind of joyous, punchy DJ material that will cut right through the murk of your average late-night set, with a twitchy, garage-house energy and crowd-pleasing anachronisms (keep your ears peeled for the Emulator loon sample on track 3). Let''s call it "<i>party techno</i>" and leave it at that.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Copies are plentiful on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/list?master_id=377880" target="_blank">Discogs</a>, but prices are on the rise. For all you CDJ warriors, <a href="https://archive.org/compress/drivetrain-god-of-the-machine/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/god-of-the-machine.zip">cop the whole rip here</a>.</p>'
