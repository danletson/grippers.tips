    text: '<p>Spring has sprung in the Bay, so it''s time to emerge from the depths of esoterica and share a lil slice of dance-floor pathos care of Chicago''s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/9804-Harmony-Funk" target="_blank">Harmony Funk</a>. <i>Before Life </i>is the duo''s first release from 1999, but it sounds like it was recorded a good 10 years earlier. The EP''s three tracks are chock full of classic Chicago house moves, with shufflin'' hats, funk basslines, and moody string stabs, all recorded with a straight-to-the-tape lo-fi energy that takes the vibe over the top.&nbsp;</p><p>On the A side, <i>Happy Feelings </i>lives up to its name in fine style, delivering swinging, funky house heat with fully chonked lo-fi percussion hits, g-funk synth lines and crooning vox. A sultry sunshine ode to the merits of partying. On the flip, the instrumental <i>Time Zone</i> goes for in-the-red catharsis, with rolling bass and wailing strings, peppered with classic drum machine clatter for the heads. <i>Can''t Let You Go</i> takes a hard turn towards the introspective, delivering a <i>Club Lonely</i>-style paranoid bedroom-house paean to a lost lover over sizzling hats and wooden kicks.</p><p>An essential bit of Chicago house history from the heart. Why not <a href="https://archive.org/compress/harmony-funk-before-life-ep/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/harmony-funk-before-life-ep.zip" target="_blank">treat yourself</a>?</p>'
