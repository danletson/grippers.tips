    text: '<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/3402-Dan-Curtin" target="_blank">Dan Curtin</a> is an absolute legend in the world of house/techno-adjacent music, with a massive discography dating back to 1992. Across dozens of releases for huge labels like Peacefrog, Strictly Rhythm, and Rush Hour, he''s honed an idiosyncratic style from his home base in Ohio, connecting the dots of chunky Chicago house, soulful Detroit techno, and bedroom beat-tape sampledelica.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/Dan-Curtin-Pregenesis/release/3836" target="_blank">Pregenesis</a> is Curtin''s fourth full-length album, released in 1999 for Belgian label Elypsia, and it''s a totally immersive introduction to his unique sonic vision. The CD version comprises 9 extended tracks and 5 short interstitials, fully mixed into a 77-minute tour-de-force of swinging machine emotion.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>The "proper" tracks are long, winding house/techno jams rippling with live, funky energy that showcases Dan''s flair for kitchen-sink sound design. There''s an improvisational joy to many of the cuts that''s downright wholesome, as Dan combines aliased 12-bit MPC stomp, soulful organ / synth riffage, and twitchy presets into unpredictable bops that are somehow deliriously complex without an ounce of pretension. He achieves the kind of chunky, soulful alchemy deployed by avant-fonk explorers like Afrikan Sciences, Titonton Duvante, or Anthony "Shake" Shakir, with an impressive ear for melodic development that makes the whole collection eminently re-listenable.&nbsp;</p><p>Although many of Dan''s releases are available on <a href="https://www.beatport.com/artist/dan-curtin/12304" target="_blank">Beatport</a>, <i>Pregenesis</i> remains sadly unavailable in digital form.
