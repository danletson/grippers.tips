    text: '<p>S² and Dex are veteran dance producers <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/223233-Santiago-Salazar" target="_blank">Santiago Salazar</a> and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/817825-Dan-Caballero" target="_blank">Dan Caballero</a>, who emerged from East LA''s backyard party scene into the city''s thriving techno underground in the mid-90s. In 2002, the duo re-located to Detroit to join the ranks of the Underground Resistance family, and helped to define the sound and political purview of the collective''s second wave in the early ''00s.&nbsp;</p><p>In the second half of the decade, both artists returned home to start their own labels. Salazar''s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/128717-Historia-y-Violencia">Historia y Violencia</a> (with Silent Servant) and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/78216-Ican-Productions" target="_blank">Ican Products</a> (with Estaban Adame) and Caballero''s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/876762-Yaxteq" target="_blank">Yaxteq</a> were and are vital platforms for LA''s underground (specifically Chicano and Latinx producers and DJs), cultivated with the same grassroots energy that put UR on the map.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Before any of that, though, came the release at hand. The otherwise untitled <i>PH001</i> is a bit of pre-history, boasting the first solo cuts ever committed to wax by either artist. The first and only release on mystery label Phases, the unassuming 4-tracker seems like a self-released effort from the duo, and judging by the 323 area code on the label, pre-dates their Motor City ambitions.</p><p>Considering the pedigree, I picked this one up fully expecting quality, and it doesn''t disappoint. Across more than 20 minutes, Salazar and Caballero explore a surprisingly eclectic assortment of vibes, from slick and moody Detroit business to leftfield bedroom chonk.&nbsp;</p><p>There''s a perfect symmetry to the EP''s construction, with S²''s Shepherd-tone dark techno stomp on <i>Next Phase of Life </i>(A1) mirroring the bongo and sub-fueled electrofunk of Dex''s <i>Eléctrico </i>(B1). On each side''s back half, things take a turn for the odd, with a killer pair of downtempo cuts. Salazar''s <i>Sometime Yesterday</i> loops low-budget metallics over churning 12-bit tom fills and heartstring-tugging jazz pads. Not to be outdone, Dex''s <i>Convergence</i> closes out the collection with a mutant groover straight from the sewer. Seasick synth lines, ghostly scratching, and a lo-fi kick / snare combo that would make Legowelt jealous.&nbsp;</p><p>Unique, essential material from two legends filled with the kind of off-kilter energy that can make early-career releases so special. Nothing doing on the web for this one, unfortunately, but <a href="https://archive.org/compress/s2-dex-ph001/formats=VBR%20MP3,JPEG&amp;file=/s2-dex-ph001.zip" target="_blank">fully grippable in 320 glory here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>'
