    text: '<p>This 1993 CD-only release is the first duo recording from Japanese avant-vocalist <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/177214-Tenko">Tenko</a> and improvising percussionist <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/124429-Ikue-Mori">Ikue Mori</a>. While Mori''s probably best known as the drummer of NYC no-wave darlings <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/125107-DNA-4">DNA</a>, she was a fixture of the downtown NYC avant-improv scene of the 80s and 90s, shifting her focus from live drumming to the manipulation of sampled percussion. Tenko shares a similar career path, having started in several post-punk outfits in Japan, and moving into more avant spheres as she developed her extended vocal technique throughout the 80s.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>On&nbsp;<i>Death Praxis,</i>&nbsp;Tenko and Mori play to their strengths, crafting an entire album from layered voice and drum machines, and friends... <b>it is totally wild</b>. Mori''s approach to rhythmic composition is absolutely alien, with simple drum loops drowned in irregular trills of pitched percussion and live-played filigree. Some tracks abandon a rhythmic pulse entirely, building uneasy soundscapes out of clattering, pointillistic drum samples. All the while, Tenko''s vocals veer from extended wailing to breathy chants, occasionally mellowing into an avant-pop baritone during the album''s quieter moments.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>Like almost any 90s avant-improv outing, the album occasionally suffers from bouts of "kitchen-sink" randomness, but overall the sheer innovation of the whole concept more than makes up for it. Rare is the album that singlehandedly invents a new genre from such simple elements, but <i>Death Praxis </i>pulls it off.&nbsp;<br><br>Plenty of copies of the original CD are floating around on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/861330">Discogs</a>, but if physical media''s not your thing, you can grip the whole album <a href="https://archive.org/compress/tenko-and-ikue-mori-death-praxis/formats=VBR%20MP3&amp;file=/tenko-and-ikue-mori-death-praxis.zip">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>'
