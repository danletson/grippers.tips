    text: '<p>In what might be a Grippers'' Tips first, I''m happy to present an honest-to-goodness album of SONGS by a BAND, the final proper album by cult German four-piece <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/691116-Inandout" target="_blank">I.A.O. aka Inandout</a>. The album was recorded in 1990 for the legendary ClockDVA-associated label <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/539935-Interfisch-Records" target="_blank">Interfisch</a>, probably most notable for going on to become the parent label for German techno institution <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/539935-Interfisch-Records" target="_blank">Tresor</a>. The band''s earlier efforts explored atmospheric dub-jazz territory, but Sublimity represents a stylistic left-turn into more electronic material, charting a thoroughly strange course into a unique sound world of melancholy FM presets, jazzy drum machine fills, and wistful, monotone incantations.</p><p>The album''s 10 tracks are without a doubt assembled in the "rock" format, with verse/chorus/bridge structures and a healthy dose of catchy hooks, but the uniquely muted-yet-synthetic sound palette and prog-lineage motifs make for a truly bizarre stew. Think Tears for Fears without the bombast, or Cocteau Twins without the catharsis.&nbsp;</p><p>The hypnotic, metronomic sequences and quiet-yet-spacious atmospheres occasionally approach Seefeel transcendence, while flirting with spooky 4AD preset goth-pop, like Dif Juz composed on an Amiga.&nbsp;<br></p>'

    text: '<p>There''s a through-line of cult-y religious overtones to the album''s lyrics, which was almost <i>de rigueur</i> at the time of its recording, as industrial subversion collided with jangling spiritualism at the end of the ''80s. While the crew doesn''t go all the way down the rabbit hole of Current 93 transubstantiation or NIN-style blasphemy, with invocations like <i>"you''re my flesh, you''re my blood, you''re the one true god"</i> there''s a smokey layer of <i>really-makes-you-think</i> Western mysticism baked in to almost every track. While it can be a bit distracting if you''re not expecting that kind of thing, it adds yet another layer to the album''s private cosmology.&nbsp;</p><p>All formats are long out of print, and<a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/list?master_id=308464&amp;ev=mb" target="_blank"> getting scarcer even on Discogs</a>.
