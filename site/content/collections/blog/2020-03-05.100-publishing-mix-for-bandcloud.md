    text: '<p>In January 2020, Grippers'' Tips compiled a guest mix for <a href="https://bandcloud.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=6e31446093c29d06d88a848a8&amp;id=8ee36e643a" target="_blank">Bandcloud</a>, everyone''s favorite long-running music mailer. The mix concept is logistical more than aesthetic, but highlights a trend that I find infinitely fascinating. Here''s the original write-up:<br></p><blockquote><p>This mix is a celebration of my favorite online-music phenomenon: the "DIY reissue." Bandcamp and other artist-centering platforms are a godsend for emerging acts, but they serve another vital role for those whose careers reach back into the pre-digital era. While deluxe vinyl reissues generate press for certain lost discographies, there''s an entire economy of defunct labels and persistent weirdos taking their recorded history into their own hands. Expired contracts, homemade vinyl rips, and unpublished archives, bringing obscure sounds from the CD era to the post-streaming ''net.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Every track in the mix is available for legal gripping on the open web, so browse the tracklist and support the artists via the links below.</p>'

Their 20+ year career has been decidedly DIY, and now the vast majority of their discography is up on Bandcamp. This album is my favorite of theirs, and deadstock LP copies are still available direct from the source!</p><hr><h3>3. Jim Horton - Simulated Winds and Cries</h3>'

    text: '<p>Spellbinding art-pop earworm from another Bay Area legend, Ellen Fullman. Ellen is known for her custom-built stringed instruments and longform drone works. Here, she teams up with fellow avant-strummer and PAN alumnus Konrad Sprenger for a truly bizarre collection of songs in the pop tradition. Vocals, verses, choruses, and hooks are all laid on top of the duo''s harmonically overloaded string machinations to brain-rewiring effect. On this track, the slow-mo shuffle and syncopated strumming combine into what could only be described as a microtonal country ballad. Alien and captivating.&nbsp;</p><p>Genuinely surprised this one isn''t more well-known. Fans of Arthur Russell, Blue Gene Tyranny, Tony Conrad, and Laurie Anderson take notice!&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>5.

After some sleuthing, I was pleased to find vinyl rips for sale on Juno, though the sound quality is less than perfect.<br></p><p>Swinging, paired down, and chunky, Wayne''s productions possess a lot of the banging, off-kilter spirit of Midwest legends like Sleep Engineer or Archetype.

Wayne Horvitz and co play an uneasy hybrid of cool jazz and minimalist improv, with traditional instrumentation underscored by subdued electronic effects and tasteful DX-7. Things get a bit goofy at times (it was 1988 after all), but for the most part the restraint of the players is admirable. This track in particular forgoes any electronic accompaniment in favor of spacious electric guitar, to gorgeous result. The album is available via Horvitz''s own Bandcamp, alongside 4 decades of his own eclectic work.&nbsp;</p>'
